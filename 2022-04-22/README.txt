### BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF DATA TAKEN####
Data was taken on the 22/04/2022 with the vtile+ with modifications (listed below). The data was taken in liquid nitrogen fully dark. 
Laser was set to minimum and attenuator was set to a maximum however we were still getting big signals so we attenuated the connection to the laser by 
slightly disconnecting the fibre.


Modifications summary:
We bridged R46 which connects the ground pin to the ground of the tile and we connected that to the shielding of the sma that connected to the scope. The core was connected to the core.

Furthermore, We added two 100 nF capacitors to the tile which are present in more recent iterations.


#####Â DATA SUMMARY #####
All data is taken using the laser trigger.


20k waveforms taken from 28V through to 38V (33V is missing as we somehow skipped it)

100k Waveform taken at 29,30,31 and 34V Bias 

Raw data is located at:/mnt/hpdaq3win/Users/sCMOS/Desktop/data_test/22-04-2022/Cold/ 

Raw data also contains noise data taken at 20, 29,30,31, 34V Bias
